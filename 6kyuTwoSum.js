//Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: (index1, index2).
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
    for (let i = 0; i <= numbers.length; i++){
      for (let j = 1; j <= numbers.length; j++){
       if(numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target)
        return [i,j]
      }
    }
  }
